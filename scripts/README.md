# Overview

This directory contains the JavaScript scripts that are used in the client side
of the application. These are imported directly into the HTML file.

## Files

- `components/`

  - Contains the web components that are used in the application.
  - The components do not have Shadow DOM, and instead enhance the descendant
    DOM elements.

- `utilities/`

  - Contains utility functions that are invoked immediately on load.
